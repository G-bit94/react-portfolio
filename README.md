#### portfolio website made w/ react
On-going development of my professional portfolio hosted using Github Pages. Inspired by the website (monkeytype.com) it has the Roboto Mono font and a nice and minimal dark theme. I love design and creative coding has been my outlet for my creativity. This is somewhere I can showcase my design skills and developer skills which is super cool. Check it out at [matthewszeto.com](https://matthewszeto.com).
